This article offers different methods for removing thorns from the skin safely and effectively. 
The first step is to cleanse the area with gentle soap and warm water. If the thorn is just poking out, it can be removed with tweezers or tape. 
If the thorn is deeply embedded, a drawing salve or vinegar soak can help bring it to the surface. For thorns covered by new skin, a needle or razor can be used to loosen the skin and expose the thorn. 
If there are signs of infection, it's best to see a doctor.
