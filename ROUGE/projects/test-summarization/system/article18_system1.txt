When you sign up for recruitment, you will most likely be assigned a recruitment counselor to help you through the process.
They will help you understand the different rounds of the process, and they are available to answer any specific questions you might have that pertain to what goes on at your university.
If you have any family members or family friends that have went through the greek system, you can have them write recommendations for you to be sent to the local sororities to which you are applying.
That’s up to you to earn.
To have a rif written for you: instruct the volunteer writers to visit their national sorority’s website.
Have those people mail the form to each of the sorority’s “recruitment chair” at the sororities’ chapter house address or mailing address.
When going through the recruitment process: dress appropriately to the particular round that you are going through.
Write down what stood out to you about the chapter.
Work with your recruitment counselor to properly fill out the forms to narrow your list down for the next round.
