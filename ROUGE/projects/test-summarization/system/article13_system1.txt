@ article they sleep during the day usually because they work at night.
If you get home from work at 5: 00 pm, you wouldn' t try to cram everything into one hour and go to sleep at 6: 00 pm.
They want to be able to wind down after work and relax before going to bed just like you.
Hopefully, they' re doing the same for you at night.
